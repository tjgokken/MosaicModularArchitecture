# Mosaic Modular Architecture (MMA)

A pragmatic, modular-first architecture for MVPs and beyond. Built with simplicity in mind and scalable by design.

## âœ¨ What is MMA?
Mosaic Modular Architecture (MMA) is a feature-first structure designed to help teams ship working software fast â€” without falling into spaghetti code hell.

It draws inspiration from:
- ðŸ§± Clean & Onion architecture (but less ceremony)
- ðŸ§© Modular folder-by-feature structure
- ðŸ§  Domain-Driven Design (only where it matters)

## ðŸ§° Key Principles
- Features live in isolation: `App/Features/X`
- Use ViewModels as glue
- Focus on clarity over purity
- Fully DI-compatible
- CLI-friendly: scaffold new features in seconds

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure 
```
/your-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ App/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Features/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Order/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Product/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Cart/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Infrastructure/
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
```bash
dotnet new install ./src/MMA_Template

cd your-folder
dotnet new mma -n YourApp
```

Use the scaffold script:
```bash
./scripts/create-feature.ps1 Wishlist
```
