## What is Mosaic Modular Architecture?
Mosaic Modular Architecture (MMA) is a lightweight, flexible architecture designed to help small teams and solo devs build well-structured MVPs that can scale. Inspired by Domain-Driven Design and feature-based modularity, MMA simplifies early-stage software architecture without falling into chaos or over-abstraction.

### Why "Mosaic"?
Each feature is a self-contained tile: independently testable, replaceable, and easy to reason about. Together, they form a complete system — modular and maintainable, like a mosaic.

### When to Use It
- You're building an MVP or v1 of a product
- You want to ship fast without creating a mess
- You plan to grow your app and team incrementally
- You want optional pathways to evolve into Clean or Onion Architecture

### How Opinionated is MMA?
MMA is intentionally *lightly opinionated*. It's not trying to dictate every part of your architecture — it's here to guide the fundamentals:

| Area                     | Opinionated? | Why                           |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 📁 Folder Structure       | ✅ Yes       | Keeps things predictable      |
| 💬 Feature Communication  | ✅ Yes       | Interfaces or events only     |
| ⚙️ Cross-cutting (e.g. DI) | ⚠️ Light     | Recommend, not enforce        |
| 🧠 Domain Modeling         | ❌ No        | Let teams evolve naturally    |
| 🚀 Messaging, CQRS, etc.  | ❌ Optional  | Leave room to layer in later  |

The idea is to prevent chaos without forcing unnecessary abstractions. MMA gives you rails, not cages.
